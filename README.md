Autoprune
=
This is a wrapper branch that shows how to use the 
*autoprune* [library](https://github.com/ICIdsl/autoprune) which uses PyTorch JIT
Tracing functionality to extract an execution graph of a network to then automatically detect
dependencies between layers in order to prune dependent layers correctly.
